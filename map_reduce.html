<h2>Map Reduce </h2>
<p>MapReduce is a processing technique designed for processing and generating large datasets that can be parallelized across a distributed computing cluster.<br>


In Hadoop, MapReduce involves two main phases: <br>
    <strong>Map phase,</strong> where input data is divided into smaller chunks and processed in parallel,  <br>
    <strong>Reduce phase,</strong> where the results from the Map phase,shuffle and reduce the data, aggregated to produce the final output.
