<strong1>Hash Function in Hive Bucketing</strong1>

<p>
. Hash functions in Hive bucketing are used to evenly distribute data across a specified number of buckets.<br>
. This helps optimize query performance and is particularly useful for tables that are frequently joined on the bucketed column.
</p>



<strong>How Hashing Works in Hive Bucketing</strong>
<p>
Let's say you have a Hive table with bucketing enabled on a column named user_id.
<br>When a new row is inserted into this table, the hash function is applied to the user_id value.
<br>
<br>The output of the hash function determines the bucket number for that row.
<br><strong>For example,</strong> if the hash value falls between 0 and (number of buckets - 1), the row goes into the corresponding bucket.
<br>
<br>The goal is to evenly distribute data across all buckets, helping with data distribution and query performance.

</p>

<strong>Example in Hive:</strong>

<p>
To create a bucketed table in Hive, you use the CLUSTERED BY clause along with the INTO BUCKETS clause in the CREATE TABLE statement. <br>
Here's a simple example:<br>

<pre>
    <code>
      CREATE TABLE bucketed_table (
  column1 INT,
  column2 STRING
)
CLUSTERED BY (column1) INTO 4 BUCKETS;
    </code>
</pre>

In this example, data in column1 will be hashed, and rows will be distributed into 4 buckets based on the hash value of column1.
