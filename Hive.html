<p>Apache Hive is a data warehousing infrastructure built on top of Hadoop.<br>
It provides a HiveQL to query and manage large datasets stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).<br>
Hive translates queries into MapReduce jobs, making it easier for users to interact with big data using familiar SQL syntax.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Difference between Hive and traditional relational databases</strong><br>
Traditional relational databases that use a schema-on-write approach where as Hive uses a schema-on-read approach.<br>
In Hive, the structure of the data is defined at the time of querying rather than during data ingestion.<br>
