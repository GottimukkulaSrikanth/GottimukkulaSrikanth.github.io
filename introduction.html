<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
I have about 10 years of experience working in the data engineering and analytics space.<br>
I’m Currently working for <company>, as a part of the data integration and processing team.<br>
I support two apps, both of which are under the demand organization. One is an etl app, the other is the reporting component.<br>
The tech stack involves Python, Shell scripting, SQL, AWS services like s3,ec2,lambda, EMR, using vertica as our warehouse. We are running our pyspark jobs on the EMR cluster.<br>
When i first joined the team I Worked on designing the solution with the team including how the data would flow through the different sub components<br>
Later I Worked on writing the processing code for multiple feeds that the team supports.<br>
Most of this code is in python with some common pieces of code in shell scripts, that perform the server-level admin tasks and file handling, including moving the data across diff components of our pipeline.<br>
Also worked on the backend SQL queries that are a part of the reporting component, as well as splunk dashboards that are meant to categorize various system and app level notifications/errors.<br>
Worked on creating the cicd pipeline on jenkins. This is a multi stage pipeline that is being used to deploy the code. I created this myself, since it's a small team and no dedicated devops folks.

So yeah that’s a little bit about myself<<br>
