<p>
 Star schema and snowflake schema are two popular database schema designs used in data warehousing. <br>
 They represent different approaches to organizing data in a relational database, especially when dealing with a large amount of structured data for reporting and analysis. <br>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <!-- Header row -->
    <th>use Case</th>
    <th>Star Schema</th>
    <th>Snowflake Schema</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
      <td>Hierarchies</td>
      <td> Hierarchies for the dimensions are stored in the dimensional table. </td>
      <td> Hierarchies are divided into separate tables.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
        <td>Data structure</td>
        <td>Denormalized Data structure and query also run faster.</td>
        <td>Normalized Data Structure.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Query Performance</td>
        <td>Usually fast because it's straightforward with single join with Fact and Dimensions.</td>
        <td>Might be a bit slower due to more complicated connections between tables.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Ease of Use</td>
        <td>Generally easier for business users to understand and navigate due to its simplicity.</td>
        <td>Can be more complex for business users to understand, especially with multiple levels of normalization.</td>
